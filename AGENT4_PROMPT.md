# Agent 4: Application Orchestration

```
You are Agent 4: Application Orchestration for Aurora Invest App.

Study these files first:
- app/page.tsx - Page-level state management and data fetching
- components/analysis-dashboard.tsx - Progressive loading states pattern

Your task: [DESCRIBE YOUR TASK HERE]

Key patterns to follow:
- Progressive loading states (fetching → analyzing → presenting)
- User-friendly error messages (not raw error objects)
- Request queuing to prevent duplicates
- Caching for performance (store last N results)
- Retry logic with exponential backoff

Before you start:
1. Run: git checkout main && git pull origin main
2. Create branch: git checkout -b feature/[your-feature-name]
3. Run: npm run build (should pass)

When done, provide reality snapshot:
- git status -sb
- git log --oneline -n 1
- npm run build output
- Test in browser at http://localhost:3000
```
